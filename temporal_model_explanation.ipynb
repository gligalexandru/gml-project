    "# 🧠 Graph-Time GCN Edge Classifier (Inductive, Snapshot-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is designed to perform **intrusion detection** on the [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) dataset by treating network traffic as a **dynamic graph** over time.\n",
    "It learns to classify whether a network **flow (edge)** is malicious or benign, based on the structure of the network and the features of each flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional GCNs, this model is **inductive** — it **does not learn node embeddings tied to IP addresses**, meaning it can generalize to **unseen IPs** in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 1. Graph Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the network traffic as a **time-evolving graph**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nodes**: IP addresses (`Src IP`, `Dst IP`)\n",
    "* **Edges**: Flows between IPs (each row in the dataframe)\n",
    "* **Edge features**: Traffic statistics (e.g., `Bwd Packet Length Min`, `Packet Length Std`, etc.)\n",
    "* **Node features**: Computed from graph structure, not learned (e.g., degrees, activity history)\n",
    "* **Labels**: Binary `target` indicating whether a flow is malicious\n",
    "\n",
    "We **bin the data by time** (e.g., 5-minute windows). Each bin creates a snapshot graph `G_t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 2. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🪄 Node Features (inductive, no embedding)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each node in a snapshot:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `in_degree`: number of incoming flows\n",
    "* `out_degree`: number of outgoing flows\n",
    "* `total_degree`: sum of in/out degrees\n",
    "* `prev_activity`: number of edges in the previous time bin\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `log1p()` normalization to stabilize scale.\n",
    "👉 These are **computed from structure**, so the model can handle **new IPs** without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Edge Features\n",
    "\n",
    "For each edge (flow):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scaled traffic statistics from the dataset (e.g., `Packet Length Std`, `SYN Flag Count`, etc.)\n",
    "* **Time encoding**: sinusoidal features (sin/cos) of the timestamp to capture periodic patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge features are concatenated into a single feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 3. Graph Neural Network (Message Passing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The GNN builds **node representations** using message passing over the graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a stack of `GraphSAGE` (or `GCN`) layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "h_v^{(l+1)} = \\sigma \\Big( W^{(l)} \\cdot \\text{AGG}\\big( {h_u^{(l)} : u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v)} \\big) \\Big)\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ( h_v^{(l)} ) is the representation of node ( v ) at layer ( l )\n",
    "* ( \\mathcal{N}(v) ) are the neighbors of ( v )\n",
    "* `AGG` is an aggregator (mean, sum, etc.)\n",
    "* ( \\sigma ) is a non-linear activation (ReLU)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Because the input ( h_v^{(0)} ) are **computed features**, not learned embeddings, the model remains **inductive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 4. Edge Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have node embeddings ( h_{\\text{src}} ) and ( h_{\\text{dst}} ), we classify edges (flows) using an MLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "z_{(u,v)} = [h_u , \\Vert , h_v , \\Vert , e_{uv}]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\hat{y}*{(u,v)} = \\text{MLP}(z*{(u,v)})\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ( e_{uv} ) = edge features\n",
    "* ( [\\cdot \\Vert \\cdot] ) = concatenation\n",
    "* ( \\hat{y}_{(u,v)} ) = predicted class (benign or malicious)\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification head outputs a 2-dimensional vector (logits) → softmax → class prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ 5. Temporal Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "We model time as a sequence of **graph snapshots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **GNN weights are shared** across all time bins.\n",
    "* Node features include **previous activity**, injecting temporal context.\n",
    "* Time encoding (sin/cos) is added to edge features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the model sensitive to **temporal patterns** (e.g., bursts of malicious traffic).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 6. Training & Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loss**: Cross-entropy on edges (flows)\n",
    "* **Optimizer**: AdamW\n",
    "* **Regularization**: Dropout, weight decay\n",
    "* **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the classifier by collecting all predictions across test snapshots:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                    | Predicted Benign | Predicted Malicious |\n",
    "| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |\n",
    "| **True Benign**    | TN               | FP                  |\n",
    "| **True Malicious** | FN               | TP                  |\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives insight into false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN), which are crucial for IDS performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Inductive Power (Key Feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard GCNs that use learned node embeddings (which break when unseen nodes appear), this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Never learns node embeddings tied to IPs**\n",
    "* Computes features **directly from structure and activity**\n",
    "* Generalizes to **new IP addresses in the test set**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This makes it well-suited for **real-world intrusion detection**, where new devices frequently appear.\n",
